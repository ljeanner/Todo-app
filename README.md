Create a new issue in the ljeanner/Todo-app repo, the issue should describe the feature to add a new button with the libelle "add" and match the syle in the figma section https://www.figma.com/design/K0uTSWn7QTIjCwRIfWrkGi/ToDo-List-%F0%9F%91%85--Community-?node-id=12-109&t=1fJUcPMWj445fsJ5-4 . The button should add a new task in the tak list, and be positionated next to the "add new task input" 

Implement this new issue in the code, make sure to use the style coming from the figma link
